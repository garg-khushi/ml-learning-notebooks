# Machine Learning Learning Notebooks

This repository contains **structured Jupyter notebooks** created while learning,
revising, and experimenting with core **machine learning and deep learning concepts**.

The notebooks serve as:
- Personal learning notes
- Algorithmic references
- Hands-on experimentation records

This repository is intentionally maintained as a **learning and reference archive**.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is **not a production project**.

It exists to:
- Build strong ML fundamentals
- Experiment with algorithms hands-on
- Maintain clean references for future projects
- Track learning progression over time

More advanced and production-oriented ML systems are maintained
in separate repositories.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Notebooks may vary in depth and polish
- Some notebooks were created earlier in the learning journey
- Content is preserved intentionally for continuity and revision
